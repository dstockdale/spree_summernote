SpreeSummernote
===============

This extention for Spree will add Summernote http://summernote.org/ the rich text editor to Spree Commerce backend. It's rough around the edges and not configurable at the moment but it suits my purposes. I'm using it in a couple of extensions and need to be able to share this between them. I'll probably extend it quite a bit as I'm already seeing a need to (like what's in the toolbar).

Installation
------------

Add spree_summernote to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_summernote'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_summernote:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
